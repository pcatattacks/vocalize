# Vocalize

## About

Vocalize is a project by Jeffrey Holm, Louisa Lee, and Pranav Dhingra for the EECS 352 - Machine Perception of Audio course under the supervision of professor Bryan Pardo and advisor Fatemah Pishdadian. Please email jholm@u.northwestern.edu with any questions.

## Motivation (why?)

Vocalize is designed to map text onto an instrumental audio signal such that the text is “sung” on top of the melody of the tune. Ultimately, we wanted to create a “text to sing” software that would combine state of the art techniques in text to speech synthesis, melody extraction, pitch identification, and autotuning so that vocals can be synthesized completely from a machine when given text and and a base instrumental audio piece.
